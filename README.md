# OutlookCal
This is a small program that I wrote during a lunch to synchronize my outlook calender with google calendar.

It will find the list of appointments for the next day from outlook and create the entries in google calendar. 
It is not a full fledged calender sync program.

Update:20-06-2024 Upgraded to use the Google Calendar API v3.0 after 12 years.
